# Issue: Add Pre-commit Linting Hooks

## Title
Add pre-commit linting hooks to ensure code quality before commits

## Type
Enhancement

## Priority
Medium

## Description
Currently, the project has linting configured in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline using `golangci-lint`. However, developers might commit code that fails linting checks, which are only discovered during the CI process. This leads to:

1. Failed CI builds
2. Additional commits to fix linting issues
3. Slower development cycle
4. Potential delay in PR reviews

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks that run the same linters as GitHub Actions
- [ ] Use the existing `.golangci.yml` configuration
- [ ] Provide easy setup instructions for developers
- [ ] Ensure the hooks can be bypassed in emergency situations (`git commit --no-verify`)
- [ ] Test that the hooks work correctly and catch linting issues
- [ ] Update project documentation with setup instructions

## Technical Requirements

1. **Linters to include in pre-commit hooks:**
   - golangci-lint (same version and config as CI)
   - gofmt
   - go vet
   - Any other linters currently used in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

2. **Implementation approach:**
   - Create pre-commit hook script
   - Use the same golangci-lint version (`v1.54` or latest)
   - Use existing `.golangci.yml` configuration
   - Provide setup script for easy developer onboarding

3. **Performance considerations:**
   - Only lint changed files to speed up commits
   - Provide option to run full lint check manually

## Files to be modified/created

- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` - Main pre-commit hook script
- `scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh` - Setup script for developers
- `README.md` - Add documentation about git hooks setup
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Update development workflow documentation

## Definition of Done

- Pre-commit hooks are implemented and working
- Setup script is created and tested
- Documentation is updated
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Changes are tested on a clean repository clone
